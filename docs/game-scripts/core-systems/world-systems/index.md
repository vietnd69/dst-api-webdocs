# World Systems Overview

## Build Information
Current documentation based on build version: **676042**
Last updated: **2025-06-21**

## System Purpose

The World Systems category provides the foundational infrastructure for creating, managing, and maintaining game worlds in Don't Starve Together. These systems collectively handle every aspect of world existence from initial generation to ongoing runtime management, ensuring consistent and engaging gameplay experiences across all world types.

### Key Responsibilities
- Complete world creation pipeline from terrain generation to entity placement
- Real-time world state management and entity lifecycle control
- Terrain and tile infrastructure for visual rendering and gameplay mechanics
- Ocean and water systems for maritime gameplay and world boundaries
- Entity and prefab management for all interactive game objects
- World generation algorithms and customization systems

### System Scope
This category encompasses all core world infrastructure but excludes high-level gameplay mechanics (handled by Game Mechanics) and user interaction systems (handled by User Interface).

## Architecture Overview

### System Components
World systems are organized in four specialized layers: entity management for interactive objects, terrain systems for ground infrastructure, generation systems for world creation, and ocean systems for water-based mechanics.

### Data Flow
```
World Generation → Terrain Creation → Entity Placement → Runtime Management
       ↓                ↓               ↓                 ↓
  Generation Config → Tile System → Prefab Instantiation → Active World
       ↓                ↓               ↓                 ↓
  Custom Presets → Ground Properties → Entity Lifecycle → Ocean Systems
```

### Integration Points
- **Fundamentals**: Entity and component systems provide the foundation for all world objects
- **Game Mechanics**: World systems provide infrastructure for gameplay systems
- **Data Management**: Save/load systems persist world state and generation data
- **User Interface**: World creation interfaces and debug visualizations

## Common Infrastructure Patterns

### Complete World Creation Pipeline
```lua
-- Standard world generation workflow
local world_data = {
    level_type = "SURVIVAL_TOGETHER",
    level_data = {
        id = "SURVIVAL_TOGETHER",
        overrides = {
            worldsize = "default",
            resources = "default"
        }
    }
}

-- Generate complete world
local savedata = GenerateNew(false, world_data)
if savedata then
    print("World created with", #savedata.ents, "entity types")
end
```

### Entity Infrastructure Management
```lua
-- Entity template with skin integration
local function my_item_fn()
    local inst = CreateEntity()
    
    -- Core infrastructure
    inst.entity:AddTransform()
    inst.entity:AddAnimState()
    inst.entity:AddNetwork()
    
    -- Apply skin system integration
    inst.entity:SetPristine()
    
    if not TheWorld.ismastersim then
        return inst
    end
    
    -- Server-side components
    inst:AddComponent("inspectable")
    
    return inst
end

-- Register with automatic skin dependency injection
return Prefab("my_item", my_item_fn, {
    Asset("ANIM", "anim/my_item.zip"),
    Asset("ATLAS", "images/inventoryimages/my_item.xml"),
})
```

### Terrain System Integration
```lua
-- Tile validation and interaction
local tile_id = TheWorld.Map:GetTileAtPoint(x, 0, z)

if TileGroupManager:IsLandTile(tile_id) then
    -- Entity can move on this terrain
    entity.components.locomotor:SetCanWalkOnLand(true)
elseif TileGroupManager:IsOceanTile(tile_id) then
    -- Handle water movement
    if TileGroupManager:IsShallowOceanTile(tile_id) then
        entity.components.locomotor:SetSpeedMultiplier(0.8)
    end
end

-- Play appropriate footstep sound
local ground_props = GROUND_PROPERTIES_CACHE[tile_id]
if ground_props and ground_props.walksound then
    entity.SoundEmitter:PlaySound(ground_props.walksound)
end
```

## World Infrastructure Dependencies

### Foundation Requirements
- [System Core](../system-core/index.md): Engine integration for rendering, physics, and file system access
- [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/index.md): Entity and component framework underlying all world objects
- [Data Management](../data-management/index.md): Asset loading, save/load persistence, and configuration storage

### Enhanced Integration
- [Game Mechanics](../game-mechanics/index.md): Gameplay systems that operate on world infrastructure
- [User Interface](../user-interface/index.md): World creation screens, debug tools, and player interaction
- [Networking](../networking-communication/index.md): Multiplayer world synchronization and shard management

## Performance Considerations

### Infrastructure Optimization
- Entity system uses shared prefab templates and cached asset loading for minimal memory overhead
- Tile system employs O(1) lookup tables and optimized terrain rendering algorithms
- World generation includes retry mechanisms and memory management for reliable creation
- Ocean systems use efficient spatial algorithms for water depth and navigation calculations

### Resource Management
- Asset preloading during initialization minimizes runtime loading overhead
- Skin system uses texture atlases and cached build data for efficient visual transitions
- Tile textures are shared across instances with optimized falloff calculations
- Generation systems implement garbage collection and resource cleanup between retries

### Scaling Characteristics
- Entity infrastructure supports 1,431+ prefab types with thousands of skin variations
- Terrain system handles hundreds of tile types without performance degradation
- World generation scales with configurable complexity and platform-specific optimizations
- Ocean systems maintain constant performance across varying world sizes

## Development Guidelines

### Infrastructure Best Practices
- Always register tile ranges before adding individual tiles to prevent ID conflicts
- Use prefab templates and skin integration for consistent entity creation patterns
- Apply world settings overrides in correct pre/post generation phases
- Follow established asset naming conventions for tiles, entities, and effects
- Test world generation with various configurations and platform constraints

### Common Infrastructure Pitfalls
- Creating entities without proper network boundaries between client and server initialization
- Modifying tile properties after world generation without considering save compatibility
- Applying post-generation settings before TheWorld entity exists
- Implementing custom validation logic that bypasses established tile and entity frameworks
- Not handling world generation failures and memory pressure gracefully

### Testing Strategies
- Validate complete world generation cycles with various presets and override combinations
- Test entity creation and skin application across all supported skin variations
- Verify tile systems render correctly with different overlay conditions and lighting
- Check ocean systems handle edge cases like shallow water and boundary transitions
- Ensure infrastructure maintains performance standards under maximum entity loads

3. **Group Classification**: Ensure tiles are properly categorized for validation systems
4. **Generation Integration**: Test tile distribution and transitions in generated worlds
5. **Audio Verification**: Validate footstep sounds and interaction audio across all conditions

## Advanced Infrastructure Features
