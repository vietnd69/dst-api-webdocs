# Character Customization Overview

## Build Information
Current documentation based on build version: **676042**
Last updated: **2025-06-21**

## System Purpose

The Character Customization category encompasses all functionality related to character and companion appearance modification in Don't Starve Together. These systems work together to provide comprehensive cosmetic customization options including character skins, clothing items, beefalo outfits, and companion modifications.

### Key Responsibilities
- Character skin management and application
- Clothing and cosmetic item definitions
- Beefalo companion customization
- Skin trading and filtering systems
- Gift and collection management
- Asset loading and visual presentation

### System Scope
This system category includes all visual customization elements but excludes gameplay mechanics (handled by Game Mechanics) and core character functionality (handled by Core Character Systems).

## Architecture Overview

### System Components
The customization system is built on a layered architecture where core utilities provide foundation services for specialized customization features like trading, filtering, and asset management.

### Data Flow
```
Asset Definitions → Skin System → Customization Interface → Visual Application
       ↓               ↓              ↓                    ↓
   Auto-Generation → Item Matching → Filter Processing → Character Rendering
```

### Integration Points
- **Character Systems**: Base character functionality and appearance management
- **Data Management**: Asset loading and customization data persistence
- **User Interface**: Customization screens and selection interfaces
- **Networking**: Cosmetic synchronization between players

## Common Customization Patterns

### Character Skin Application
```lua
-- Apply character skin with validation
local function ApplyCharacterSkin(player, skin_id)
    if TheInventory:CheckOwnership(skin_id) then
        local skin_data = GetSkinData(skin_id)
        if skin_data and skin_data.type == "base" then
            player:SetSkin(skin_id)
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

### Clothing Item Management
```lua
-- Equip clothing item with symbol overrides
local function EquipClothingItem(character, clothing_id)
    local clothing = CLOTHING[clothing_id]
    if clothing and clothing.symbol_overrides then
        for _, symbol in ipairs(clothing.symbol_overrides) do
            character.AnimState:OverrideSymbol(symbol, clothing_id, symbol)
        end
        character.equipped_clothing = clothing_id
    end
end
```

### Beefalo Customization
```lua
-- Apply complete beefalo theme set
local function ApplyBeefaloTheme(beefalo, theme)
    local clothing_types = {"body", "feet", "head", "horn", "tail"}
    for _, part in ipairs(clothing_types) do
        local item_name = "beefalo_" .. part .. "_" .. theme
        local clothing = BEEFALO_CLOTHING[item_name]
        if clothing then
            ApplyBeefaloClothing(beefalo, clothing)
        end
    end
end
```

### Skin Filtering and Trading
```lua
-- Filter skins by multiple criteria
local function FilterSkinsByCategory(full_list, category, rarity)
    local filters = {{category, rarity}}
    return ApplyFilters(full_list, filters)
end

-- Validate trading selection
local function ValidateTradeSelection(selections)
    local count = GetNumberSelectedItems(selections)
    local recipe = GetBasicRecipeMatch(selections)
    return count > 0 and recipe ~= nil
end
```

## Customization System Dependencies

### Required Systems
- [Core Character Systems](../core/index.md): Base character functionality and components
- [Data Management](../../data-management/index.md): Asset loading and persistence
- [User Interface](../../user-interface/index.md): Customization interfaces

### Optional Systems
- [Game Mechanics](../../game-mechanics/index.md): Achievement-based unlocks
- [Networking](../../networking-communication/index.md): Multiplayer cosmetic sync

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Skin systems use dynamic loading for texture assets
- Clothing data is cached for frequently accessed items
- Asset streaming optimizes memory usage based on equipped items

### Performance Optimizations
- Skin filtering uses efficient lookup tables and early termination
- Symbol overrides batch rendering operations for multiple items
- Asset loading prioritizes currently equipped and previewed items

### Scaling Considerations
- Systems support extensive skin collections with thousands of items
- Filtering operations scale efficiently with large inventories
- Trading system handles complex recipe validation without performance impact

## Development Guidelines

### Best Practices
- Always validate skin ownership before applying visual changes
- Use the filtering utilities for consistent skin categorization
- Follow established naming conventions for new cosmetic items
- Test customization changes across all supported characters

### Common Pitfalls
- Bypassing ownership validation for development convenience
- Not handling missing asset data gracefully in custom skins
- Modifying auto-generated data files instead of source systems
- Creating visual conflicts between clothing items and character features

### Testing Strategies
- Test all customization options with every playable character
- Verify skin filtering works correctly with edge cases
- Validate trading recipes with various item combinations
- Test asset loading performance with large skin collections

## Customization Integration Patterns

### With Character Systems
Customization systems enhance character functionality:
- Visual changes reflect character personality and player choice
- Cosmetic items respect character-specific design constraints
- Skin affinity ensures visual consistency with character themes

### With User Interface
Customization drives UI presentation:
- Character selection screens display available skins
- Inventory interfaces show owned cosmetic items
- Trading screens facilitate skin exchange workflows
- Collection displays track customization progress

### With Asset Management
Customization integrates with game asset pipeline:
- Dynamic loading reduces memory footprint
- Asset streaming supports large cosmetic collections
- Texture optimization maintains visual quality
- Animation integration preserves character expressiveness

## Collection and Trading Systems

### Skin Collections
- **Themed Sets**: Coordinated items that work together visually
- **Character Affinity**: Items designed for specific characters
- **Rarity Tiers**: Classification system from Common to Elegant
- **Gift Categories**: Special acquisition methods and presentations

### Trading Mechanics
- **Recipe System**: Defined exchanges between rarity levels
- **Validation Logic**: Ensures fair and balanced trading
- **Filter Generation**: Helps players find compatible items
- **Selection Management**: Streamlined trading interface

## Asset and Technical Architecture

### Auto-Generation Pipeline
- **Source Processing**: Export scripts generate definitions from game data
- **Asset Organization**: Systematic categorization of visual resources
- **Validation Systems**: Ensure data integrity and completeness
- **Update Automation**: Seamless integration with game build process

### Performance Architecture
- **Streaming Groups**: Organized asset loading for memory efficiency
- **Dynamic Loading**: On-demand resource allocation
- **Caching Strategies**: Optimized access to frequently used data
- **Network Optimization**: Minimal data synchronization requirements

## Troubleshooting Customization Issues

### Common Customization Problems
| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|----|----|----|
| Skins not displaying | Visual changes not applied | Check ownership and asset loading |
| Clothing conflicts | Visual artifacts or missing parts | Verify symbol override compatibility |
| Filter not working | Incorrect item lists | Validate filter criteria and data |
| Trading validation fails | Cannot complete trades | Check recipe requirements and selection |

### Debugging Customization Systems
- Use skin debug commands to inspect loaded assets
- Verify customization data integrity with validation functions
- Check character compatibility with skin affinity mappings
- Review asset loading status for missing resources

## Future Development

### Extensibility Design
- Customization systems support easy addition of new cosmetic categories
- Asset pipeline accommodates diverse visual styles and themes
- Trading framework adapts to new exchange mechanisms
- Collection system scales with expanding content library

### Integration Planning
- New cosmetic features should leverage existing utility systems
- Consider performance implications of large-scale visual changes
- Plan for cross-system compatibility with character and UI updates
- Design for mod compatibility and community content creation
