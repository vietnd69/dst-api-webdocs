## Common Achievement Patterns

### Core Achievement Checking
```lua
-- Check basic achievement unlock status
local achievements = require("achievements")
local achievement = achievements[1] -- survive_20

-- Platform-specific ID access
local steam_id = achievement.id.steam    -- "1_survive_20"
local psn_id = achievement.id.psn        -- 1
```

### Event Achievement Management
```lua
-- Create and configure event achievements
local event_achievements = EventAchievements()

-- Load event data
local event_data = {
    eventid = "winter_feast",
    seasons = {"winter"},
    achievements = {
        {
            name = "Daily Challenges",
            data = {
                {achievementid = "daily_1", daily = true},
                {achievementid = "event_1", daily = false}
            }
        }
    }
}
event_achievements:LoadAchievementsForEvent(event_data)

-- Check completion status
local is_unlocked = event_achievements:IsAchievementUnlocked("winter_feast", "winter", "daily_1")
```

### Community Progression Tracking
```lua
-- Initialize community progression
local progression = CommunityProgression()
progression:RegisterForWorld()

-- Check unlock status
if progression:IsUnlocked("trails") then
    -- Content is available
end

-- Request updated data
progression:RequestAllData(false, TheNet:GetUserID())
```

## Achievement System Dependencies

### Required Systems
- [Data Management](../../data-management/index.md): Achievement data persistence and loading
- [Networking](../../networking-communication/index.md): Server synchronization and platform integration
