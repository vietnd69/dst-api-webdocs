# Game Configuration Modes Overview

## Build Information
Current documentation based on build version: **676042**
Last updated: **2025-06-21**

## System Purpose

The Game Configuration Modes category provides the fundamental infrastructure for managing different game modes, handling core game logic, and processing game events in Don't Starve Together. These systems establish the technical foundation for game state management, mode-specific behaviors, and event-driven communication throughout the game.

### Key Responsibilities
- Manage different game mode configurations and their specific rules
- Handle core game initialization, world management, and main game loop
- Provide robust event handling and inter-component communication
- Control game lifecycle from startup through world generation and gameplay
- Coordinate between frontend/backend states and manage save/load operations

### System Scope
This category includes core game configuration infrastructure but excludes high-level gameplay mechanics (handled by Game Mechanics) and user interface systems (handled by User Interface).

## Architecture Overview

### System Components
Game Configuration Modes are implemented as low-level infrastructure services that provide the foundation for all game functionality. The systems work together to establish the runtime environment and operational parameters for the game.

### Data Flow
```
Game Startup → Mode Configuration → Event System → Game Logic → World State
     ↓                ↓                 ↓             ↓            ↓
Mode Selection → Rule Loading → Event Handlers → Asset Loading → Gameplay
```

### Integration Points
- **Character Systems**: Game modes affect character capabilities and restrictions
- **World Systems**: Mode configuration determines world generation and behavior
- **Game Mechanics**: Events and logic drive all gameplay interactions
- **Data Management**: Save/load operations depend on mode configuration and game state
- **Networking**: Multiplayer synchronization uses event system for communication

## Common Infrastructure Patterns

### Game Mode Configuration
```lua
-- Get current game mode properties
local ghost_enabled = GetGhostEnabled()
local spawn_mode = GetSpawnMode()
local has_renewal = GetHasResourceRenewal()

-- Check recipe validity for current mode
local is_valid = IsRecipeValidInGameMode("survival", "resurrectionstatue")
```

### Event System Usage
```lua
-- Create and configure event processor
local event_processor = EventProcessor()

-- Add event handler
local handler = event_processor:AddEventHandler("player_died", function(player, cause)
    print("Player", player, "died from", cause)
    -- Handle player death logic
end)

-- Trigger events
event_processor:HandleEvent("player_died", ThePlayer, "starvation")
```

### Game Logic Integration
```lua
-- Check session status
if InGamePlay() then
    local session_time = GetTimePlaying()
    -- Handle session-specific operations
end

-- Record achievements
RecordEventAchievementProgress("SURVIVE_DAYS", player, {
    days = TheWorld.state.cycles
})
```

## Infrastructure Dependencies

### Required Systems
- [System Core](../system-core/index.md): Engine integration and low-level platform services
- [Data Management](../data-management/index.md): Save file operations and data persistence
- [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/index.md): Core entity and component framework

### Optional Systems
- [World Systems](../world-systems/index.md): Enhanced world generation and management
- [Character Systems](../character-systems/index.md): Character-specific mode behaviors
- [Networking](../networking-communication/index.md): Multiplayer mode synchronization

## Performance Considerations

### System Performance
- Game mode configuration uses efficient lookup tables for property access
- Event system minimizes overhead through optimized handler management
- Game logic coordinates asset loading to prevent memory spikes
- Session tracking uses lightweight time accumulation

### Resource Usage
- Mode configurations are cached in memory for fast access
- Event handlers use weak references to prevent memory leaks
- Game logic manages asset streaming based on available memory
- Save/load operations use chunked processing for large worlds

### Scaling Characteristics
- Event system scales efficiently with increasing handler count
- Game modes support unlimited custom mode additions through mods
- Game logic handles variable world sizes and complexity
- Performance monitoring built into core game loop

## Development Guidelines

### Best Practices
- Always validate game mode properties before using them in gameplay logic
- Use the event system for loose coupling between components
- Follow proper event handler cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Design mode-specific features to be easily configurable
- Test all game modes for feature compatibility and performance

### Common Pitfalls
- Assuming all game modes support the same features (check mode properties)
- Not cleaning up event handlers when components are destroyed
- Bypassing the event system for direct component communication
- Hardcoding game mode behaviors instead of using configuration properties
- Not considering multiplayer implications for mode-specific features

### Testing Strategies
- Test game initialization across all supported game modes
- Verify event system performance with high handler counts
- Test save/load operations with complex world states
- Validate mode property inheritance and override behavior
- Test cross-mode compatibility for shared gameplay features

## System Integration Patterns

### With Character Systems
Game configuration modes establish the rules and constraints that character systems must follow:
- Mode properties determine available character features
- Event system coordinates character state changes
- Game logic manages character persistence across sessions

### With World Systems
Infrastructure provides the foundation for world behavior:
- Game modes configure world generation parameters
- Event system triggers world state changes
- Game logic coordinates world loading and initialization

### With Game Mechanics
Core infrastructure enables all gameplay features:
- Mode configuration determines available mechanics
- Event system drives mechanic interactions
- Game logic provides the runtime environment for mechanics

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- Game mode property lookup time
- Event handler registration and execution performance
- Game initialization and world loading duration
- Memory usage during asset loading and world population
- Save/load operation performance across different world sizes

### Optimization Strategies
- Cache frequently accessed mode properties
- Use event batching for high-frequency updates
- Implement progressive asset loading for large worlds
- Optimize save data serialization and compression
- Monitor and limit event handler proliferation

## Troubleshooting Infrastructure Issues

### Common Configuration Problems
| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|----|----|----|
| Mode properties not applying | Features behave incorrectly | Check world settings overrides |
| Events not triggering | Components not responding | Verify handler registration |
| Game initialization failing | Loading errors or crashes | Check asset dependencies and save data |
| Performance degradation | Slow response or frame drops | Review event handler count and complexity |

### Debugging Infrastructure
