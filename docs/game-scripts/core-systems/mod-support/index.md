## Common Mod Support Patterns

### Content Status Checking
```lua
-- Check if any mods are enabled
if AreAnyModsEnabled() then
    print("Community mods are active")
end

-- Check specific mod status
if KnownModIndex:IsModEnabled("workshop-12345") then
    -- Mod-specific functionality
end

-- Check DLC status
if IsDLCEnabled(REIGN_OF_GIANTS) then
    print("Reign of Giants DLC is enabled")
end
```

### Configuration Management
```lua
-- Mod configuration access (within mod environment)
local mod_setting = GetModConfigData("difficulty_level")

-- DLC-aware character management
local characters = GetActiveCharacterList()
local selectable = GetSelectableCharacterList()
```

### Content Integration
```lua
-- Add mod character
AddModCharacter("mycharacter", "FEMALE", {
    { type = "normal_skin", play_emotes = true },
    { type = "ghost_skin", anim_bank = "ghost" }
})

-- DLC string construction
local item_name = ConstructAdjectivedName(inst, "meat", "wet")
-- Result: "wet meat" or "meat wet" based on language configuration
```

### Version Compatibility
```lua
-- Check game version for mod compatibility
if CurrentRelease.GreaterOrEqualTo("R35_SANITYTROUBLES") then
    -- Use newer game features
end

-- Upgrade legacy mod data
local upgraded_level = modcompatability.UpgradeModLevelFromV1toV2(mod, level_data)
```

## System Dependencies

### Required Systems
- [System Core](../system-core/index.md): Engine integration and file system access
- [Data Management](../data-management/index.md): Content configuration and save data persistence
- [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/index.md): Basic entity, component, and action systems

### Optional Systems
- [Character Systems](../character-systems/index.md): Character integration and customization
- [User Interface](../user-interface/index.md): Content management and configuration screens

- Configuration data cached to minimize file system access
- Content registry maintains efficient lookup structures

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of content configuration and assets
- Efficient content discovery using cached directory scans
- Optimized loading order based on dependency analysis
- DLC state checking optimized for frequent world generation calls

### Scaling Considerations
- System supports dozens of concurrent mods without performance degradation
- DLC support scales efficiently with multiple content packages
- Memory usage scales linearly with enabled content count
- String construction performance independent of content volume

## Development Guidelines

### Best Practices
- Always check content enablement before accessing specific features
- Use appropriate utility functions for error handling and debugging
- Follow established patterns for content registration and configuration
- Handle version compatibility gracefully across different game builds
- Use proper dependency declaration in content metadata

### Common Pitfalls
- Accessing content-specific features without checking enablement status
- Bypassing content loading systems for custom initialization
- Not handling compatibility across different API versions
- Assuming content installation equals enablement
- Not using proper error handling functions for debugging context

### Testing Strategies
- Test content with various combinations of other mods and DLC
- Verify configuration persistence across save/load cycles
- Test compatibility with different game versions and builds
- Validate error handling with corrupted or missing content data
- Test localization with different language configurations

## Content Integration Patterns

### With Character Systems
Mod support integrates with character systems to:
- Register mod-defined characters with appropriate metadata
- Handle DLC-specific character availability and unlocking
- Manage character-specific assets and customization options
- Support character progression and skill system integration

### With World Generation
Content systems coordinate with world generation to:
- Enable content-specific world features and biomes
- Provide parameter-driven content state management
- Handle content-specific prefab and resource placement
- Support multiple world generation contexts and configurations

### With Asset Loading
Mod support works with asset systems to:
- Load content-specific assets and resources on demand
- Handle asset conflicts between multiple content packages
- Provide fallback mechanisms for missing content assets
- Enable hot-reloading during development and testing

### With Localization
Content support enhances localization through:
- Intelligent string construction based on language rules
- Content-specific string handling and formatting
- Function-based dynamic naming for complex localization needs
- Integration with translation systems for international content

## Troubleshooting Content Issues
