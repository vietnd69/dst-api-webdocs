# AI Systems Overview

## Build Information
Current documentation based on build version: **676042**
Last updated: **2025-06-21**

## System Purpose

The AI Systems category provides the fundamental infrastructure for artificial intelligence in Don't Starve Together. These systems enable complex entity behaviors through modular, performance-optimized frameworks that manage decision-making, state transitions, and behavior coordination across all AI entities in the game.

### Key Responsibilities
- Provide hierarchical decision-making frameworks for entity AI
- Manage state machines for behavior and animation coordination
- Coordinate AI lifecycle and performance optimization across all entities
- Enable modular, reusable behavior components for different entity types

### System Scope
This infrastructure category includes core AI frameworks and management systems but excludes specific entity behaviors (handled by individual brain implementations) and game-specific AI logic (handled by prefab-specific brain files).

## Architecture Overview

### System Components
The AI systems are built on a three-layer architecture where Brain management coordinates Behavior Trees and State Graphs to create sophisticated AI patterns:

```
Entity AI Lifecycle → Brain System → Behavior Trees → AI Decisions
                                  ↘ State Graphs → Animation/State Management
```

### Data Flow
```
AI Input Events → Brain Manager → Decision Framework → State Transition
       ↓               ↓              ↓                    ↓
Entity Events → Performance Mgmt → Tree Execution → Animation Update
```

### Integration Points
- **Entity Framework**: All AI systems integrate through the core entity component system
- **Performance Manager**: Global AI performance optimization and sleep/wake cycles
- **Animation System**: State graphs coordinate with animation states
- **Event System**: Event-driven behavior triggers and communication

## Common AI Infrastructure Patterns

### Brain Initialization
```lua
-- Standard AI setup pattern
local brain = require("brains/custombrain")
inst:AddComponent("brain")
inst.components.brain:SetBrain(brain)

-- Brain automatically integrates with global manager
```

### Behavior Tree Construction
```lua
-- Hierarchical decision-making structure
local bt = BT(inst,
    PriorityNode({
        -- High priority: emergency behaviors
        IfNode(function() return inst.components.health:GetPercent() < 0.3 end,
               "Emergency",
               ActionNode(function() inst:Flee() end, "Escape")),
        
        -- Default: normal behavior
        ActionNode(function() inst:DoIdle() end, "Idle")
    })
)
```

### State Machine Integration
```lua
-- State-based behavior coordination
local stategraph = StateGraph("entity", {
    State{
        name = "idle",
        tags = {"idle"},
        onenter = function(inst) 
            inst.AnimState:PlayAnimation("idle")
        end,
        events = {
            EventHandler("attacked", function(inst)
                inst.sg:GoToState("combat")
            end),
        },
    }
}, {}, "idle")
```

## AI Infrastructure Dependencies

### Required Systems
- [Core Framework](../core/index.md): Entity and component foundation for AI attachment
- [Actions System](../actions/index.md): Action framework for AI behavior execution

## Performance Considerations

### System Performance
- Brain manager implements sophisticated sleep/wake cycles to optimize CPU usage
- Behavior trees use node-level sleep optimization for expensive operations
- State graphs minimize update frequency through hibernation strategies
- Global coordination reduces redundant AI calculations across entities

### Resource Usage
- AI systems use memory pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Behavior trees cache node evaluation results to reduce computation
- State machines optimize memory through shared state definitions
- Performance scaling adapts to entity proximity and player attention

### Scaling Characteristics
- AI performance automatically adjusts based on entity distance from players
- Sleep optimization increases with entity count to maintain frame rate
- Behavior complexity scales with available CPU budget
- Global AI manager balances load across all active entities

## Development Guidelines

### Best Practices
- Design AI behaviors as modular, reusable components using the behavior tree framework
- Implement proper sleep strategies for expensive AI operations to maintain performance
- Use event-driven patterns for reactive behaviors rather than constant polling
- Follow the three-layer architecture: Brain → Behavior Tree → State Graph

### Common Pitfalls
- Creating deep behavior tree hierarchies that impact performance and maintainability
- Implementing AI logic without proper sleep optimization for non-critical operations
- Bypassing the brain management system for custom AI implementations
- Not considering multiplayer synchronization requirements for AI state

### Testing Strategies
- Test AI behavior under various performance conditions and entity counts
- Verify proper cleanup and resource management during AI lifecycle transitions
- Validate behavior tree logic with edge cases and unexpected state combinations

- Behavior trees implement game-specific logic like combat, crafting, and exploration
- State graphs coordinate gameplay actions with appropriate animations
- Brain management ensures AI performance doesn't impact game responsiveness

### With Performance Systems
