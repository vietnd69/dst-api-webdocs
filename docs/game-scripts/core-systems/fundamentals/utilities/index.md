### System Scope
This category includes foundational utility functions used across all game systems but excludes specific gameplay mechanics (handled by Game Mechanics) and high-level component systems (handled by Core Systems).

## Architecture Overview

### System Components
The utilities are organized into specialized modules that provide focused functionality while maintaining loose coupling between different utility types. Each module serves specific domains while sharing common patterns for error handling and parameter validation.

local distance_sq = distsq(pos1, pos2)
```

-- Object-oriented vector math
local direction = (target_pos - start_pos):GetNormalized()
local scaled_vector = direction * speed

-- Performance-optimized vector operations
local x, y, z = Vec3Util_Add(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)
local norm_x, norm_y, norm_z = Vec3Util_Normalize(x, y, z)
```

## System Dependencies

### Required Systems

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Mathematical Operations**: Use squared distance calculations to avoid expensive square root operations
- **Vector Operations**: Choose between object-oriented Vector3 class and performance-optimized Vec3Util functions based on use case
- **Entity Searching**: Utilize tag-based filtering and radius limitations to minimize search overhead
- **String Operations**: Cache frequently accessed character dialogue and use efficient string manipulation functions
- **File Operations**: Leverage asynchronous file operations and platform-specific optimizations

### Memory Management
- Vector utilities avoid object creation overhead for high-frequency calculations
- String utilities implement efficient caching mechanisms for character speech
- Performance utilities use circular buffers and controlled data collection
- Table utilities provide in-place operations where possible

### Scaling Considerations
- Entity finding functions scale well with proper tag usage and radius constraints
- Performance monitoring adapts to server size and player count
- Mathematical utilities maintain consistent performance regardless of game state
- File operations handle large datasets through asynchronous processing

## Development Guidelines

### Best Practices
- Use appropriate utility functions for each domain (math, string, vector, etc.)
- Choose between object-oriented and functional approaches based on performance requirements
- Validate inputs to utility functions to ensure robustness
- Leverage caching mechanisms where available to improve performance
- Use squared distance calculations for proximity checks when exact distance isn't needed
- Apply consistent error handling patterns across utility usage

### Common Pitfalls
- Creating unnecessary Vector3 objects in performance-critical loops
- Using exact string matching instead of utility functions for character speech
- Ignoring platform-specific optimizations in file operations
- Performing expensive calculations repeatedly instead of caching results
- Not validating entity existence before applying utility operations

### Testing Strategies
- Test mathematical utilities with edge cases (zero, negative, infinity)
- Verify vector operations maintain mathematical correctness
- Validate string utilities with different character types and special cases
- Test performance utilities under various load conditions
- Ensure file utilities handle missing files and permission errors gracefully
