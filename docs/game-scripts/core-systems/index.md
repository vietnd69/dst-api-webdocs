## Core Systems Architecture

The DST API is organized into several interconnected core systems that provide the foundation for all game functionality. These systems work together to create the complete Don't Starve Together experience.

### System Categories

The core systems are organized into these major categories:

#### Game Foundation
Systems that provide the basic building blocks for all game functionality.

#### Player Experience  
Systems that directly impact how players interact with the game world.

#### Content Management
Systems that handle game assets, data, and content organization.

#### Development Support
Systems that assist with development, debugging, and maintenance.

## Development Guidelines

### System Dependencies
- **Core Dependencies**: Fundamentals must be initialized first
- **Layer Dependencies**: Higher-level systems depend on lower-level infrastructure
- **Optional Dependencies**: Some systems provide enhanced functionality when available

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Management**: Each system has specific memory usage patterns
- **Update Frequency**: Systems update at different frequencies based on need
- **Resource Sharing**: Systems share common resources efficiently

### Best Practices
- Always initialize fundamentals before other systems
- Use the event system for loose coupling between systems
- Follow the component pattern for modular functionality
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between system categories

## Function Integration Patterns

### Core Function Categories

#### System Initialization Functions
```lua
-- System startup pattern
function InitializeCoreSystem(systemName, config)
    local system = CreateSystem(systemName)
    system:LoadConfiguration(config)
    system:InitializeComponents()
    system:RegisterEventHandlers()
    return system
end
```

#### Cross-System Communication Functions
```lua
-- Event-based communication
function BroadcastSystemEvent(eventName, data)
    for _, system in pairs(GetActiveSystems()) do
        if system:HandlesEvent(eventName) then
            system:ProcessEvent(eventName, data)
        end
    end
end
```

#### Component Management Functions
```lua
-- Component lifecycle management
function AttachSystemComponent(entity, componentType, data)
    local component = CreateComponent(componentType, data)
    entity:AddComponent(component)
    RegisterComponentWithSystem(component, componentType)
    return component
end
```

### Function Integration Guidelines

#### Dependency Management
- **Function Registration**: All core functions must be registered with dependency system
- **Initialization Order**: Functions dependent on other systems initialize after dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Functions implement consistent error handling patterns
- **Performance Monitoring**: Critical functions include performance tracking

#### Cross-System Function Calls
```lua
-- Safe cross-system function invocation
function CallSystemFunction(systemName, functionName, ...)
    local system = GetSystem(systemName)
    if system and system[functionName] then
        return system[functionName](system, ...)
    else
        LogError("Function not available: " .. systemName .. "." .. functionName)
        return nil
    end
end
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common System Issues
| Issue | Affected Systems | Solution |
|----|---|----|
| Initialization order | Fundamentals, All | Ensure core systems load first |
| Memory leaks | Data Management | Follow proper cleanup procedures |
| Performance drops | All | Check profiling tools |
| Function conflicts | Cross-system | Use namespace isolation |

### Debugging Workflow
1. Identify which system category contains the issue
2. Use development tools to isolate the problem
3. Check system-specific documentation for solutions
4. Follow integration guidelines for cross-system issues

### Function Debugging
```lua
-- Debug function execution
function DebugFunctionCall(systemName, functionName, ...)
    local startTime = GetTime()
    local result = CallSystemFunction(systemName, functionName, ...)
    local endTime = GetTime()
    
    LogDebug(string.format("Function %s.%s executed in %.2fms", 
        systemName, functionName, (endTime - startTime) * 1000))
    
    return result
end
```
