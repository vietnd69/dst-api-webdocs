# Relationship Between Island Adventures Case Studies

This document explains the relationship between the two Island Adventures case studies and how they complement each other to provide a comprehensive understanding of large-scale mod development for Don't Starve Together.

## Overview of the Case Studies

The Island Adventures mod is examined through two complementary case studies:

1. **[Island Adventures Core](case-ia-core.md)** - Focuses on the technical implementation and architecture
2. **[Island Adventures Gameplay](case-island-adventures.md)** - Focuses on the gameplay systems and mechanics

These two documents are designed to be read together to gain a complete understanding of both the technical foundation and the gameplay design of this comprehensive mod.

## Complementary Focus Areas

### Technical vs. Gameplay Perspectives

The two case studies approach the same mod from different angles:

| Island Adventures Core | Island Adventures Gameplay |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Code structure and organization | Player experience and game flow |
| Component architecture | Gameplay systems integration |
| Technical implementation details | Game design decisions |
| Integration with DST's core systems | Balance considerations |
| Network synchronization | Progression systems |

### Example Comparison

To illustrate how the two documents complement each other, consider how they each approach the ocean and sailing mechanics:

**Island Adventures Core (Technical Focus):**
```lua
-- From case-ia-core.md
function BoatTrawler:StartTrawling()
    self.trawling = true
    self.trawltime = 0
    self:SetTrawlDistance(0)
    self.inst:StartUpdatingComponent(self)
    self.inst:PushEvent("trawlstart")
end

-- Sea/Skyworthy (portal) implementation
local function OnActivate(inst, doer)
    if not inst:HasTag("active") then
        return false
    elseif not (doer ~= nil and doer:HasTag("player")) then
        return false, "NOTPLAYER"
    end

    local world = TheWorld
    if world == nil or world.net == nil then
        return false
    end

    local target_shard = nil
    for shard_id, _ in pairs(world.net.components.shardstate:GetConnectedShards()) do
        target_shard = shard_id
        break
    end

    if target_shard == nil then
        return false, "NOWORLD"
    end

    -- Initiate migration to other world
    TheWorld:PushEvent("ms_playerdespawnandmigrate", {
        player = doer, 
        worldid = target_shard,
        portal_id = inst.components.worldmigrator.id
    })
    
    return true
end
```

**Island Adventures Gameplay (Gameplay Focus):**
```lua
-- From case-island-adventures.md
function BoatPhysics:OnUpdate(dt)
    -- Apply wind forces
    if TheWorld.components.worldwind ~= nil then
        local wind_speed = TheWorld.components.worldwind:GetWindSpeed()
        local wind_direction = TheWorld.components.worldwind:GetWindDirection()
        
        -- Calculate wind force based on direction and sail state
        local sail_force = 0
        if self.has_sail and self.sail_raised then
            -- Calculate angle between boat and wind
            local boat_angle = self.inst.Transform:GetRotation() * DEGREES
            local angle_diff = math.abs(DiffAngle(boat_angle, wind_direction))
            
            if angle_diff < 45 * DEGREES then
                -- Wind is behind, strong push
                sail_force = wind_speed * TUNING.BOAT.WIND_FORCE * 1.5
            elseif angle_diff < 90 * DEGREES then
                -- Wind is to the side, moderate push
                sail_force = wind_speed * TUNING.BOAT.WIND_FORCE
            elseif angle_diff < 135 * DEGREES then
                -- Wind is at an angle, slight push
                sail_force = wind_speed * TUNING.BOAT.WIND_FORCE * 0.5
            else
                -- Wind is against, minimal push
                sail_force = wind_speed * TUNING.BOAT.WIND_FORCE * 0.1
            end
        end
        
        -- Apply force in boat's forward direction
        local angle = self.inst.Transform:GetRotation() * DEGREES
        local vx = math.cos(angle) * sail_force
        local vz = -math.sin(angle) * sail_force
        
        self.velocity_x = self.velocity_x + vx * dt
        self.velocity_z = self.velocity_z + vz * dt
    end
```

While both examples show code related to boats, the Core case study focuses on the component structure and integration with other systems, while the Gameplay case study emphasizes the physics simulation and how wind direction affects player experience.
