# Localization in Don't Starve Together Mods

This section provides comprehensive guides and resources for implementing multilingual support in Don't Starve Together mods, allowing your creations to reach a global audience.

## Why Localize Your Mod?

Localization offers several important benefits:

- **Wider Audience**: Reach players who don't speak your language
- **Better User Experience**: Native language support improves usability
- **Community Engagement**: Encourages international community contributions
- **Workshop Visibility**: Localized mods often receive more attention and subscriptions

## Localization Components

The localization process involves several key components:

- [Multilingual Support Implementation](multilingual-support.md) - Basic setup for supporting multiple languages
- [String Table Management](string-tables.md) - Organizing and managing translatable text
- [Font Handling](font-handling.md) - Supporting different character sets and writing systems
- [Localization Best Practices](best-practices.md) - Guidelines for effective localization
- [Testing Localized Content](testing-localization.md) - Ensuring quality across all supported languages

## Key Concepts

When localizing Don't Starve Together mods, you'll work with:

- **String Tables**: Collections of text strings organized by language
- **Language Files**: Separate files containing translations for each supported language
- **Character Encoding**: Proper encoding to support special characters and non-Latin scripts
- **Font Assets**: Custom fonts for languages with unique character requirements
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Systems to handle missing translations

## Getting Started

If you're new to localization, we recommend starting with the [Multilingual Support Implementation](multilingual-support.md) guide, which walks through the basic setup process for adding language support to your mod.
