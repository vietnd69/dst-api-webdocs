## Version History

## Overview

The `skin_affinity_info.lua` file contains character-specific skin affinity mapping data that defines which character skins are associated with each playable character in Don't Starve Together. This file is automatically generated by the `export_accountitems.lua` script and serves as a central registry for character skin relationships.

## Usage Example

```lua
-- Access skin affinity data
local skin_affinity_info = require("skin_affinity_info")

-- Get all skins for Wilson
local wilson_skins = skin_affinity_info.wilson

-- Check if a specific skin exists for a character
local function has_character_skin(character, skin_name)
    local character_skins = skin_affinity_info[character]
    if character_skins then
        for _, skin in ipairs(character_skins) do
            if skin == skin_name then
                return true
            end
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

## Data Structure

The file returns a single table where each key is a character name and each value is an array of skin identifiers associated with that character.

### Character Data Format

```lua
{
    [character_name] = {
        "skin_identifier_1",
        "skin_identifier_2",
        "skin_identifier_3",
        -- ... more skin identifiers
    }
}
```
