## Common Progression Patterns

### Character Unlock Progression
```lua
-- Check character unlock availability
local progressionconstants = require("progressionconstants")
local player_xp = GetPlayerXP()
local unlocked_characters = progressionconstants.GetRewardsForTotalXP(player_xp)

-- Calculate progression toward next unlock
local current_level, progress_percent = progressionconstants.GetLevelForXP(player_xp)
print(string.format("Level %d (%.1f%% to next)", current_level, progress_percent * 100))
```

### Skill Tree Management
```lua
-- Skill activation with validation
local skilltree = SkillTreeData()
local character = "wilson"
local skill = "wilson_torch"

if skilltree:GetAvailableSkillPoints(character) > 0 and
   skilltree:IsValidSkill(skill, character) then
    
    if skilltree:ActivateSkill(skill, character) then
        print("Skill activated successfully")
        skilltree:Save() -- Persist changes
    end
end
```

### WX-78 Module System
```lua
-- Module creation and installation
local wx78_moduledefs = require("wx78_moduledefs")

-- Create custom module
local heat_module = {
    name = "heat",
    slots = 3,
    activatefn = function(inst, wx, isloading)
        wx.components.temperature.mintemp = wx.components.temperature.mintemp + 20
        wx.components.temperature.maxtemp = wx.components.temperature.maxtemp + 20
    end,
    deactivatefn = function(inst, wx)
        wx.components.temperature.mintemp = wx.components.temperature.mintemp - 20
        wx.components.temperature.maxtemp = wx.components.temperature.maxtemp - 20
    end
}

local netid = wx78_moduledefs.AddNewModuleDefinition(heat_module)
```

### Festival Experience Tracking
```lua
-- WXP progress monitoring
local wxputils = require("wxputils")

local current_level = wxputils.GetActiveLevel()
local progress_percentage = wxputils.GetLevelPercentage()
local progress_string = wxputils.BuildProgressString()

print(string.format("Festival Level %d: %s (%.1f%%)", 
    current_level, progress_string, progress_percentage * 100))
```
