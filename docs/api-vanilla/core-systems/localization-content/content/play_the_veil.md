## Overview

The `play_the_veil` module implements "The Veil" - a mysterious and dramatic theatrical performance for the Don't Starve Together stage play system. This dark philosophical play explores themes of truth, illusion, and revelation through the interactions of three archetypal characters: the wise Sage, the foolish Halfwit, and the servile Toady. The play features dramatic lighting effects, including a climactic blackout sequence.

## Usage Example

```lua
local veil_play = require("play_the_veil")

-- Access costume definitions
local costumes = veil_play.costumes
local sage_costume = costumes["SAGE"]

-- Access play scripts
local scripts = veil_play.scripts
local main_play = scripts["THEVEIL"]

-- Get starting act
local starting_act = veil_play.starting_act  -- "THEVEIL"
```

## Play Structure

### Story Summary

**"The Veil"** is a philosophical allegory presented as a single continuous act. The play explores:

- **Truth vs. Illusion**: The Sage attempts to guide others toward enlightenment
- **Ignorance and Servitude**: The Halfwit and Toady represent different forms of unenlightenment  
- **The Nature of Reality**: Culminates in a dramatic revelation about the nature of existence
- **Death and Rebirth**: Ends with a symbolic death and resurrection sequence

### Character Archetypes

| Character | Role | Symbolism |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| SAGE | Wise Teacher | Knowledge, enlightenment, truth |
| HALFWIT | Foolish Student | Ignorance, confusion, innocence |
| TOADY | Servile Follower | Sycophancy, false wisdom, corruption |

## Costumes

### Costume Definitions

```lua
costumes = {
    ["SAGE"] = {
        head = "mask_sagehat",
        name = STRINGS.CAST.SAGE
    },
    ["HALFWIT"] = {
        head = "mask_halfwithat", 
        name = STRINGS.CAST.HALFWIT
    },
    ["TOADY"] = {
        head = "mask_toadyhat",
        name = STRINGS.CAST.TOADY
    }
}
```

### Available Costumes

| Costume | Head | Body | Description |
|---------|------|------|-------------|

| HALFWIT | mask_halfwithat | (none) | Simple-minded but pure character |
| TOADY | mask_toadyhat | (none) | Obsequious and manipulative character |

## Technical Features

### Unique Lighting System

"The Veil" is the only play that uses the blackout system:

```lua
{actionfn = fn.enableblackout, duration = 0.1},   -- Blackout starts
{actionfn = fn.stopbgmusic, duration = 1},        -- Music stops
-- Critical dialogue in darkness
{actionfn = fn.disableblackout, duration = 4},    -- Blackout ends
```

**Purpose**: Creates dramatic emphasis for the play's climactic revelation about the nature of reality.

### Special Visual Effects

#### Mask Blinking Effect

```lua
{roles = {"HALFWIT"}, duration = 3.5, actionfn = fn.do_mask_blink}
```

- Applies special mask blinking effect to the Halfwit
- Creates supernatural/mystical atmosphere
- Unique to this play among the theatrical performances

#### Death/Revival Sequence

```lua
-- All characters die symbolically
{roles = {"TOADY","SAGE","HALFWIT"}, duration = 2.0, anim="death", endidleanim="death_idle"},
-- Characters revive
{roles = {"TOADY","SAGE","HALFWIT"}, duration = 2.0, anim="parasite_death_pst"}
```

**Symbolism**: Represents the death of illusion and rebirth into truth.

### Character Interactions

The play features complex character dynamics:

1. **Opening Greetings**: All characters wave to each other and audience
2. **Dance Sequences**: Toady and Halfwit perform elaborate dances
3. **Philosophical Dialogue**: Sage attempts to teach wisdom
4. **Conflict**: Growing tension between characters  
5. **Revelation**: Truth is revealed through the veil metaphor
6. **Transformation**: Symbolic death and rebirth of understanding

### Musical Progression

The play uses two distinct musical phases:

**Phase 1 - Happy Music** (Opening):
- Light, cheerful music during introductions
- Characters are naive and optimistic
- Represents the illusion of simple happiness

**Phase 2 - Mysterious Music** (Middle):
- Dark, ominous music as truth emerges
- Characters face difficult realities
- Builds to the blackout climax

**Phase 3 - Silence** (Climax):
- All music stops during blackout
- Emphasizes the stark revelation
- Creates powerful dramatic impact

### Animation Choreography

The play features elaborate animation sequences:

| Character | Primary Animations | Symbolic Meaning |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| SAGE | emoteXL_angry, emoteXL_waving4, emoteXL_happycheer | Wisdom, teaching, enlightenment |

## Integration Example

```lua
local veil_play = require("play_the_veil")
local fn = require("play_commonfn")

-- Setup the main play
local play = veil_play.scripts["THEVEIL"]
local costumes = veil_play.costumes

-- Verify cast has proper masks
for _, character in ipairs(play.cast) do
    local costume = costumes[character]
    if costume and costume.head then
        -- Ensure player has costume.head equipped
        -- Note: No body costume required for this play
    end
end

-- Execute play with special attention to lighting effects
for _, line in ipairs(play.lines) do
    if line.actionfn == fn.enableblackout then
        -- Prepare for dramatic blackout sequence
        print("Starting blackout sequence...")
    elseif line.actionfn == fn.disableblackout then
        -- Blackout ending
        print("Blackout sequence complete")
    end
    
    -- Execute the line
    if line.actionfn then
        line.actionfn(stage_inst, line, cast_data)
    end
end
```

## Comparison with Other Plays

| Feature | The Veil | The Enchanted Doll |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Costume Complexity** | Masks only | Full body + head costumes |
| **Story Structure** | Single continuous act | 9 scenes across 3 acts |
| **Character Count** | 3 archetypal figures | 9+ characters with transformations |

## Performance Notes

### Staging Recommendations

1. **Character Positioning**: 
   - SAGE center stage for authority
   - TOADY and HALFWIT on opposite sides (symbolic opposition)

2. **Timing Considerations**:
   - Allow full blackout effect to complete
   - Ensure mask blinking effect is visible to audience
   - Coordinate music transitions with character development

3. **Cast Coordination**:
   - All three characters must be present for main play
   - Individual soliloquies can be performed separately
   - Requires good coordination for group death/revival sequence
