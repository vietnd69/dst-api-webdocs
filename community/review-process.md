# Review and Merge Process

This document outlines the process for reviewing and merging contributions to the Don't Starve Together API Documentation.

## Review Process Overview

All contributions to the documentation go through a review process to ensure quality, accuracy, and consistency. Here's how the process works:

1. **Submission**: Contributor submits a pull request (PR)
2. **Initial Check**: Automated checks verify formatting and basic requirements
3. **Maintainer Review**: A maintainer reviews the content and provides feedback
4. **Revision**: Contributor addresses feedback (if needed)
5. **Approval**: Maintainer approves the changes
6. **Merge**: Changes are merged into the main branch
7. **Deployment**: Documentation site is automatically updated

## Review Criteria

When reviewing contributions, maintainers look for:

### Technical Accuracy

- Information is factually correct
- Code examples work as described
- API usage is consistent with current game version
- Proper versioning information is included

### Documentation Quality

- Follows the [documentation standards](documentation-standards.md)
- Clear, concise, and understandable writing
- Proper formatting and organization
- Appropriate cross-references to related content

### Completeness

- Covers all relevant aspects of the topic
- Includes necessary examples and explanations
- Addresses common use cases and potential issues

## Review Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 3-5 business days
- **Full Review**: Within 1-2 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Follow-up Reviews**: Within 3-5 business days after revisions

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for:

- Providing clear, constructive feedback
- Suggesting specific improvements
- Helping contributors meet documentation standards
- Ensuring technical accuracy of content
- Making final decisions about merging contributions

## Contributor Responsibilities

Contributors are expected to:

- Respond to feedback in a timely manner
- Make requested changes or explain why changes aren't appropriate
- Follow the documentation standards
- Be respectful and collaborative during the review process

## The Merge Process

Once a contribution is approved:

1. A maintainer will merge the PR into the main branch
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy the updated site
3. The changes will be live on the documentation site within minutes
4. The PR will be closed and tagged appropriately

## After Merging

After your contribution is merged:

- Your name will be added to the contributors list (if it's your first contribution)
- You may be invited to review future contributions in your area of expertise
- The issue related to your contribution (if any) will be closed

## Special Cases

### Large Contributions

For very large contributions (e.g., documenting multiple components or systems):

- The PR may be broken into smaller, more manageable parts
- Reviews may be conducted in stages
- Multiple maintainers may be involved in the review process

### Controversial Changes

For changes that involve significant restructuring or controversial content:

- Additional maintainers may be consulted
- A discussion period may be established
- Community input may be solicited

## Continuous Improvement

The review process itself is subject to improvement. If you have suggestions for making the process better:

- Open an issue with your suggestions
- Discuss ideas in the community Discord
- Provide feedback directly to maintainers
