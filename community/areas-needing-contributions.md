# Areas Needing Contributions

This page highlights specific areas of the Don't Starve Together API Documentation that need contributions. If you're looking to help improve the documentation, these are great places to start.

## High Priority Areas

These areas have been identified as most in need of attention:

### Component Documentation

- **Missing Components**: Several components still need documentation:
  - `Writeable` - For items that can be written on (signs, books)
  - `Saddler` - For items that can be used as saddles
  - `Boatphysics` - For boat movement and physics
  - `Repairable` - For items that can be repaired
  - `Spellcaster` - For casting spells and magical effects

- **Incomplete Components**: These components have basic documentation but need expansion:
  - `Stategraph` - Needs more detailed examples and integration information
  - `Timer` - Needs more comprehensive examples
  - `Moisture` - Needs better integration examples with other systems
  - `Drownable` - Needs more detailed property documentation

### Core Systems Documentation

- **Network System**: Needs more detailed explanations of:
  - Client-server communication patterns
  - Network variable synchronization
  - RPC best practices and optimization

- **Mod Structure**: Needs better documentation on:
  - Advanced mod organization patterns
  - Multi-file mod structures
  - Managing dependencies between mods

### Examples and Tutorials

- **Advanced Tutorials**: Need tutorials covering:
  - Creating custom UI screens and widgets
  - Implementing custom crafting systems
  - Creating complex AI behaviors
  - Optimizing mod performance

- **Example Improvements**: Existing examples need:
  - More comments explaining the code
  - Alternative approaches for different scenarios
  - Error handling and edge cases

## Medium Priority Areas

These areas would benefit from improvement but are less critical:

### Localization Documentation

- Expand examples of implementing localization
- Add more information about font handling for non-Latin scripts
- Document best practices for translation workflows

### World Generation

- Improve documentation on custom world generation
- Add examples of creating custom biomes
- Document room and level generation algorithms

### API Updates

- Document recent API changes in game updates
- Create migration guides for deprecated features
- Add compatibility notes for different game versions

## Documentation Improvements

These are general improvements that could be made across the documentation:

### Cross-Referencing

- Add more links between related components and systems
- Ensure consistent cross-referencing patterns
- Create visual relationship diagrams between components

### Code Examples

- Add more practical, real-world examples
- Ensure all examples follow best practices
- Add comments explaining complex code sections

### Formatting and Organization

- Ensure consistent formatting across all documentation
- Improve navigation between related topics
- Add more visual aids (diagrams, screenshots) where helpful

## How to Contribute
