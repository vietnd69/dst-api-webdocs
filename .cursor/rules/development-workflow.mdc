# Development Workflow

This document outlines the workflow for developing and maintaining the documentation site.

## Local Development

To start the local development server:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000/` with hot-reloading enabled.

## Building

To build the site for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates static content in the `build` directory that can be served by any static hosting service.

## Testing Built Site

To test the production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will serve the built website locally.

## Deployment

The site is configured for GitHub Pages deployment:

1. Build the site using `npm run build`
2. Deploy using `npm run deploy`

The `deploy` script uses the `docusaurus deploy` command, which builds the website and pushes it to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository.

## File Organization

When adding new documentation:

1. Place new API documentation in the appropriate subdirectory under `/docs/api-vanilla/`
2. Update the sidebar configuration in [sidebars.ts](mdc:dst-api-webdocs/dst-api-webdocs/sidebars.ts) to include the new page
3. Use consistent naming conventions for files and directories

## Updating Dependencies

To update Docusaurus and other dependencies:

```bash
npm update
```

Check for breaking changes in the Docusaurus documentation when updating to a new major version.
