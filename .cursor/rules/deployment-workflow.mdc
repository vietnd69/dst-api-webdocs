# Deployment Workflow

This document outlines the workflow for deploying the Don't Starve Together API documentation site.

## Deployment Methods

The documentation site can be deployed using two methods:

### 1. Automatic Deployment with GitHub Actions

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](mdc:dst-api-webdocs/dst-api-webdocs/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

The workflow:
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Node.js
3. Installs dependencies
4. Builds the website
5. Deploys to GitHub Pages

### 2. Manual Deployment

You can also deploy manually using:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command:
1. Builds the site
2. Pushes the built files to the `gh-pages` branch

## GitHub Pages Configuration

The GitHub Pages configuration in [docusaurus.config.ts](mdc:dst-api-webdocs/dst-api-webdocs/docusaurus.config.ts) is:

```ts
const config: Config = {
  // ...
  url: "https://vietnd69.github.io",
  baseUrl: "/dst-api-webdocs/",
  organizationName: "vietnd69",
  projectName: "dst-api-webdocs",
  trailingSlash: false,
  deploymentBranch: "gh-pages",
  // ...
};
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

1. All documentation is accurate and up-to-date
2. Links and cross-references are working
3. Code examples are valid
4. Images and assets are properly referenced
5. The site builds without errors locally

## Testing Deployment Locally

To test the production build locally before deploying:

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

This will build the site and serve it locally with the production configuration.

## Checking GitHub Pages Configuration

To verify your GitHub Pages configuration:

```bash
npm run check-github-pages
```

This script checks that:
1. The repository exists
2. GitHub Pages is enabled
3. The deployment branch exists
4. The site is accessible

## Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

If you encounter issues with deployment:

1. **Build Errors**: Check the build logs for any errors
2. **GitHub Pages Settings**: Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. **Permissions**: Ensure the GitHub token has write permissions
4. **Branch Issues**: Check if the `gh-pages` branch exists and is properly configured
5. **URL Issues**: Verify the `url` and `baseUrl` in `docusaurus.config.ts` are correct

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:

1. The site is accessible at https://vietnd69.github.io/dst-api-webdocs/
2. Navigation and links work correctly
3. Images and assets are loading properly
4. The search functionality is working
5. The site displays correctly on different devices

## Deployment Schedule

- **Automatic Deployments**: Occur whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch
- **Manual Deployments**: Performed as needed for urgent updates or when GitHub Actions is not available

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are found after deployment:

1. Fix the issues in the `main` branch
2. Push the changes to trigger a new deployment
3. If necessary, revert to a previous commit and deploy manually
